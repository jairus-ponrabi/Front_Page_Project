	 <center><h1>I make user-experience focused </br>websites that your users will love</h1>
	 <p>Let’s face it, a lot of websites suck. I’m trying to change that by making every website </br>designed with purpose and meaning that are specifically crafted to have the best user-</br>experience. This means users have an easy time navigating or finding the content they </br>want without any distractions or hurdles. To you, this means more business.</p>
	 </br> 
	 <p>A lot of websites dont follow both basic and advanced UX design practices, This </br>causes the website to be less converting (loss of sales & leads), harder </br>to use, harder to understand, and overall less effective. I aim to prevent this with my no-B.S. way of </br>designing websites. My goal is to make the Internet a more usable and beautiful place, </br>with one website at a time.</p>
